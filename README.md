# Tkinter-GUI-PC-Cleaning-Program
An app developed by me to learn how to use Tkinter and also clean my PC in the process

If anybody is reading this then you've most likely searched for a tkinter GUI app. My app is far from an introduction to GUI making with Tkinter. For such things I recommend the sources I used: 
http://thinkingtkinter.sourceforge.net/
https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TkCmd/contents.htm
https://effbot.org/tkinterbook/entry.htm
http://www.java2s.com/Code/Python/GUI-Tk/EntryTextfieldwithalabelinsideaborderpanel.htm

The app is filled with comments for understanding my logic behind the things I've done. If you use the app, then please make sure to read the starting message.

I found this project quite enjoyable and will pick up on the bugs in the future. Now I must focus on creating my first neural network. 

So long and thanks for all of the fish!!
